# Rash-Evographs

The project, developed for a course about Multimedia at my university, is an integration to the RASH Framework (https://github.com/essepuntato/rash) code to enable the creation and insertion of Graphs, using the JQuery plugin EvoGraphs (http://www.evoxlabs.org/whitecane/evographs), from some input csv data.
